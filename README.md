## About The Project

The React application presents the basic concepts of the framework through interactive examples. The structure consists of two main sections:

Core Concepts – a list of key concepts (components, JSX, props, state), dynamically rendered based on data from the data.js file. Each element is displayed as a separate CoreConcept component.

Examples – an interactive menu with buttons (TabButton) allowing you to select a topic.

The selected button sets the selectedTopic state using the useState hook.

After selection, the content section (tab-content) displays the title, description and sample code for the topic, retrieved from the EXAMPLES object.

If the user does not select any topic, the application prompts with the message: ‘Please select a topic.’

The whole thing creates a simple but functional educational application demonstrating the use of:

Functional components

The useState hook for state management

Props and dynamic list rendering

Conditional content rendering in React
